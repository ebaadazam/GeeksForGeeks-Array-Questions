## GeeksForGeeks-Array-Questions
#### Hello everyone! So I was looking for some of the DSA Questions to solve on Coding Websites. And I came across the 'Top 50 Array Interview Questions' on GeeksFor Geeks. These are literally some of the most frequently asked interview questions on Arrays DSA.
#### The Questions are divided on every sort of level- Easy, Medium or Hard. While splving I noticed my solutions were taking way too much time to execute so I tried the another approach and come up with the most accurate solution with much less Time Complexity. Nevertheless I have provided both of my codes with less as well as high Time Complexity just to have a deeper understanding of the problem. Have a look at all the solution I have done!
